Note: This Book Sucks! is a work-in-progress.

We've all heard of GoodReads.com, right? It's great for non-readers who need
book recommendations. But what about voracious readers who need to remove
books from their elephantine to-read lists?

That's where This Book Sucks! comes in. Users can write scathing reviews
about terrible books in order to convince people to remove them from their
to-read-lists. And for those who are masochistic and morbidly curious about
these bad books, they can add said books to their to-read list and laugh
at the stupidity.

Since this is a simple app, there is a master list of 10 "bad books" (mostly
by Jodi Picoult, but "Twilight", "50 Shades of Grey", and "The Da Vinci Code"
are included, of course.)

I drew a wireframe for the frontend as well as ERDs for the backend.

I went back and forth between the backend and frontend, but I'm realizing now
I probably should have completed as much of one as I could before moving
on to the other.

Right now the app returns books from the backend, and the user is able
to add books to a to-read list (albeit only superficially for now)

Upon resubmission, I will have all RESTful routes set up, including the
ability to write and read scathing book reviews.
